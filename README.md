### proof_of_concept
This folder contains a proof-of-concept example using DEMs derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys carried out in Spring 2018 for [Advanced Surveying](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YZRd6Lm_55ifhLs4GWryK41jetzRzhxjB65Yv5LBi1A/edit) at the University of Washington.
