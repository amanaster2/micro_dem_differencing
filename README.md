# Using digital elevation model differencing to understand small-scale changes

## Summary
This repository contains code used to estimate sediment mass displacement on a small scale using digital elevation modeling (DEM) differencing.  

## Repository Navigation
This repository will be periodically updated with more examples. Currently, there is one example.  

### proof_of_concept
This folder contains a proof-of-concept example using DEMs derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys carried out in Spring 2018 for [Advanced Surveying](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YZRd6Lm_55ifhLs4GWryK41jetzRzhxjB65Yv5LBi1A/edit) at the University of Washington. More information regarding the workflow used in the example can be found on [this](https://github.com/amanaster2/micro_dem_differencing/wiki/Script-Workflow) page.
